# Hello World Payload

I couldn't find any template projects for NX payloads, so I made one based on [Lockpick_RCM](https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM), with the help of its developer, [shchmue](https://github.com/shchmue).

## Usage
Inject the `.bin` file over USB with TegraRcmGUI or a similar injector.

## Building
Install [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/) and run `make`.

Massive Thanks to CTCaer!
Lockpick_RCM is heavily based on [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate). Beyond that, CTCaer was exceptionally helpful in its development.
